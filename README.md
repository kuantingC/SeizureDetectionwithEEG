Deep learning models demonstrate incredible successes
in different fields including computer vision, molecular biology,
and natural language processing. As one trending
track of deep learning, end-to-end learning requires less
feature engineering steps compared to traditional machine
learning models. It can automatically learn the internal
representation of the input data and reveal latent patterns
in the input data that cannot be captured by conventional
data analysis techniques.

In this project, we apply end-to-end learning on the motor
task classification problem based on electroencephalography
(EEG) signals collected from 9 individual subjects.
We compare the model performance on different modern
deep learning architectures, including shallow and deep
convolution neural network as well as the recurrent neural
network. In addition, transfer learning technique is used to
tackle the issue of the inter-subject variance of EEG signal.
We observe an average 9.58% (2.21%) improvement on
the models we developed.

This study shows the deep neural network make a prediction
without handcrafted features given from conventional
preprocessing techniques and the capability of transfer
learning and Gaussian noise to adapt the characteristic
of subject-specific EEG recordings.
